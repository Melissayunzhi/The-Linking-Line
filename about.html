          <p>
            <em>The Linking Line</em> is a research-led exhibition and performance project developed by 
            artist, researcher, and curator <strong>José Abad Lorente</strong>. 
            It explores the intersection of language, calligraphy, dyslexia, and visual thinking, 
            questioning how language can be reshaped through visual and bodily processes.
          </p>
          <br>
      <p>
        Drawing inspiration from traditional Chinese calligraphy, as well as his personal experiences 
        navigating language and neurodiversity, Lorente seeks to reimagine writing not as a fixed system, 
        but as a living, fluid gesture. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <em>The Linking Line</em> proposes that writing can evolve from a linear, letter-based tradition 
        into a multidimensional and inclusive space for diverse ways of understanding and communicating.

      <h2>Research and Theory</h2>
      <p>
        Central to <em>The Linking Line</em> is the idea that dyslexic thinking patterns — 
        such as the simultaneous visualization of words, the stacking of consonants, 
        or the creation of neologisms — offer valuable insights into alternative forms of literacy.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Lorente examines how calligraphic gestures and ideographic structures (e.g., Chinese characters) 
        already encode complex meaning beyond sequential spelling. 
        In this way, the project builds bridges between different traditions of writing: 
        Eastern pictographic systems, Western alphabetic models, and emergent neurodiverse languages.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Through practice-based exploration, <em>The Linking Line</em> seeks to open new portals 
        between thought, movement, and inscription — making visible the often hidden architectures 
        of human language.
